## Installing a release

Every release is built for the following platforms:

- Windows x64
- macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon)
- macOS x64 (Intel)

### Windows

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/ixnas/Quickwarden/releases) and download the latest installer.
This would be the file that's called `quickwarden-<version>-windows-x64-setup.exe`.

Run the installer.
If a Windows Defender dialog pops up, click "More info" and then click "Run anyway".

### macOS

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/ixnas/Quickwarden/releases) and download the latest release for your platform:

- For Apple Silicon Macs, download `quickwarden-<version>-macos-arm64.dmg`.
- For Intel-based Macs, download `quickwarden-<version>-macos-x64.dmg`.

Open the disk image by right-clicking it and clicking Open.

Because this application is not signed and notarized by Apple, you'll have to manually allow the downloaded disk image to open.
Open System Settings and go to "Privacy & Security".
Scroll to the Security section and click "Open anyway".

Now you can copy the application to your Applications folder and eject the disk image.
You may have to repeat the steps above when you launch Quickwarden for the first time.

## Usage
When you first start Quickwarden on macOS you might have to grant access to the Accessibility API.
This enables Quickwarden to be shown by using a global shortcut.

After you start Quickwarden, use **Ctrl+Alt+P** on Windows, or **⌘⌥P** on macOS to open the main window.

To set up your Bitwarden account, use **Ctrl+S** on Windows, or **⌘S** on macOS to open the settings window.
From there you can sign in to your Bitwarden account.

You can now use Quickwarden to search through your vault!

## Building from source
### Development
For development, you'll need the following:
- .NET 10 SDK
- Bitwarden CLI (must be in your PATH environment variable)

The source code in the `src` directory consists of the following projects:
- **Quickwarden.UI** contains the application's entry point and the UI code.
- **Quickwarden.Application** contains all the high level logic.
- **Quickwarden.Infrastructure** contains the low-level implementation details.
- **Quickwarden.Tests** contains tests for the high level application logic.

If you're developing on Windows, make sure to use the `net9.0-windows*` target framework.

### Packaging
To create a package, run the script for your current platform in the `scripts` directory.
The packages will be created in the `dist` directory.

## Security

This application uses Bitwarden CLI under the hood.
When you sign in, Quickwarden will pass your credentials to Bitwarden CLI.
Your credentials won't ever be stored by Quickwarden, they will only be used to obtain a session key from Bitwarden CLI.

This session key is used to access your vault through the Bitwarden CLI.
Quickwarden will load your vault into memory, it will never store any vault data.

Any other data that Quickwarden needs to operate is always stored fully encrypted using AES encryption.
This currently consists of:

 - E-mail addresses for signed-in users
 - Bitwarden CLI vault locations and session keys
 - IDs of your most recently used vault items

The key to unlock this data is stored in your platform's credential manager.
On Windows Quickwarden will use Windows Hello, on macOS it'll use Keychain.

On Windows, other applications won't be able to access this data without you first authenticating with Windows Hello.
Unfortunately Windows doesn't have a mechanism to identify apps and restrict stored credentials to a specific application, so never accept Windows Hello prompts from apps you don't trust.
Quickwarden will only ever trigger a prompt just after it starts up.

On macOS, only applications that you specifically allow to access the Quickwarden Keychain entry will have access to Quickwarden's data.
Whenever you update Quickwarden and the Keychain prompt comes up saying that Quickwarden wants to access your Quickwarden keychain entry, click "Always Allow".
The prompt won't come up anymore until you update Quickwarden again.
In no other circumstance should you ever allow any app access to this entry.

## Use of Bitwarden CLI

This software, Quickwarden, is released under the BSD 2-Clause License (see LICENSE.txt file). It is an independent project and does not contain or link to any GPLv3-licensed source code.

However, this project invokes an external command-line tool called `bw` (Bitwarden CLI), which is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3).

We have releases that include an unmodified binary distribution of this GPLv3-licensed tool for convenience.
When you run Quickwarden, it may execute the external program as a subprocess, similar to how a shell script or build system might invoke external tools.

Alternatively, you may choose to not use our distribution that includes this binary.
You can then install Bitwarden CLI yourself from your operating system's package manager or from Bitwarden's official distribution.

To comply with the GPLv3, we are providing:
